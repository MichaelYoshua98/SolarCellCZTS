## ABSTRACT
Until 2017, the world’s need for electricity has reached 25,606 TWh, where 65.8% of them was produced by gas, crude oil, and coal. Meanwhile, the energy supply from renewable energy sources excluding water is just around 9%. The energy demand is predicted to increase by 30,000 TWh in 2050, which makes the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission become the next consideration. According to OECD, the CO2 emission has reached its highest record, which is 32.8 billion ton, by the end of 2017. Therefore, the usage of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) solar cells could potentially be the best alternative solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to fully replace the fossil fuel. Currently, most of the commercial solar cell is made of silicon. However, this type of solar cell needs a high fabrication cost. On the other hand, CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) which has higher efficiency, utilized toxic materials which hinder the commercialization stage. Thus, it is very important to use another materials like Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) which has the same structure as CIGS and also has a high theoretical efficiency up to 32%. <br>
<br>
One of the factors that lower the efficiency of CZTS is this material consists of four elements so that the formation of intrinsic defects in this material is high. Based on the experiment result, the most stable CZTS surface is the (112)/(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{112}">) facet. Yet, the polar surface makes it very reactive, and could be more stable after the surface reconstruction. Another option that may stabilized the surface is due to the defects in the surface construction. On the other hand, the defects in the material could alter the electronic structure, which is one of the key factors in determining the solar cell’s performance. For that reason, we want to learn the effects of the defects that may be formed in the (112)/(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{112}">) CZTS surface, starting from the defect’s formation energy to the electronic structure.<br>
<br>
We hope that this research can give a wider view of intrinsic defects roles to the CZTS solar cell’s performance.
